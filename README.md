# HTML painter

The program allows you to create rectangle drawings in HTML tables.

Read in other languages: [English](README.md), [Русский](README.Russian.md)

# Description of the program

The program generates images of multi-colored rectangles that are passed to the input via the parameter when the program starts.
The result of the program is a file `output.html ` which is created in the same directory where the program was launched.<br>
This file contains minimal content for displaying an HTML page with a table in the Browser.

# Using the program in a Docker container:

 0. Create and launch a container by following the instructions [below](#launching-in-docker)<br>
 	The container will launch a script that will launch the `HTML painter` program,<br>
 	by giving it the input path to the file specified at the start of the container,<br>
 	and also start the **nginx** server and replace the default page, <br>
 	by the page generated by the program.<br>
1. Before starting the container, add the file that will need to be passed to the program's input to the 'tests' folder<br>
 	and when starting the container, pass the file name with the last parameter.<br>
 	
 - The container can be started without meping volumes, by default, when creating a container, there are 2 files in the `tests` folder:<br>
   `multiple` and `two_squares` and you can use them to run program, for example:<br>
    
```
docker run --rm -it -p 80:8080 html_painter two_squares
```

   This command will launch the container and pass the path to the `two_squares` file in the `tests` folder inside the container.<br>
   <br>
2. By default, the server is available at `172.17.0.2`<br>
 	when the container is running, go to this address, <br>
 	the page will be displayed.<br>
3. To terminate the container, the script waits for the input of the `exit` command<br>
when entering the container completes its work and is deleted.<br>

# Using the program for self-assembly:

  0. Assemble the program by following the instructions [below](#assembly-using-cmake)
  1. Run the `./html_paint` program in the console in the `bin/` folder<br>
  - The program can be run with or without parameters:<br>
  - When starting the program, an additional parameter must be passed the path to the file,<br>
    which contains the coordinates of the rectangles (upper left and lower right<br>
    angle in the form: X1 Y1 X2 Y2 ...)<br>
  - If you run the program without parameters, it will start in testing mode and <br>
    will try to build a table from a file in the folder `./../tests/multiple` <br>
    relative path on which the program is running and outputs the result to the error stream.<br>
  2. After generating the **html** file, open it in the browser to view the result.<br>
  
# Launching in Docker:

0. Creating a docker image (In the root folder of the project with Dockerfile, run the command):<br>

```
docker build -t html_painter .
```

1. To start the container, enter the following command:<br>

```
docker run\
	 --rm\
	 -v ${PWD}/tests:/app/tests\
	 -it\
	 -p 80:8080\
	 html_painter\
	 two_squares
```

- `--rm` in Docker is used to automatically delete the container and its associated files when the container is shut down.<br>
- `-v ${PWD}/tests:/app/tests` is used to create a link between the host file system and the container file system.<br>
 	Allows you to add new files to run in the container. All files located in the `tests` folder, <br>
 	located in the same directory from where the container is launched, they become available inside the container<br>
 	and can be used to pass as a parameter to the program.<br>
- `-it` starts the container in interactive mode with connection to the container terminal.<br>
- `-p 80:8080` is used to bind container ports to host ports.<br>
- `two_squares` - parameter passed to the program running in the container,<br>
 	 allows you to pass the path to the file located in the `tests` folder by its name.<br>

# Assembly using Cmake

To build a program in linux OS:<br>
0. To build, you need to install **Cmake**<br>
1. Being in the root folder of the project, create and navigate to the `build` folder:<br>

```
mkdir build
cd build
```
2. Run the commands to build the program:<br>
```
cmake .. 
cmake --build .
```
3. The finished program is saved to the `bin` folder in the root directory of the project:<br>
